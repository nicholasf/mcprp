An MCP server that helps with content generation for roleplaying games

I currently maintain a very extended session with Claude.ai which discusses aspects of a Dungeons & Dragons campagin I am running for a group of friends.

I copy and paste the Markdown exports from the session into a flat file arrangement kept in git. The arrangement of the folders looks something like:

```
/sessions
/items.md
npcs.md
background.md
campaign.md

```

I want to create an MCP server that an LLM can interact with to load campaign information and record it.
